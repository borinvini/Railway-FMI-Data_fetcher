## Overview  

❯ **Railway-FMI-Data-Fetcher** is a Python-based project designed to fetch and process data from two key open data sources in Finland:  
- **[Digitraffic API](https://www.digitraffic.fi/)** – Provides Finnish railway data, including real-time train timetables, station metadata, and operational status.  
- **[FMI (Finnish Meteorological Institute) API](https://github.com/pnuu/fmiopendata)** – Supplies weather observation data from environmental monitoring stations (EMS) across Finland.

> **Disclaimer:**  
> There is a complementary GitHub repository for this project, designed to visualize the data fetched here using a Streamlit interface.
<br> You can find it at: ➡️ [Railway-FMI-Data-Viewer](https://github.com/borinvini/Railway-FMI-Data_viewer.git)

##  Project Goal

❯ This project aims to create a unified dataset that merges railway timetable information with weather data, enabling more comprehensive analysis of how weather conditions affect train operations. The data is matched using the Haversine formula to identify the closest weather station to each train track. The train track can be a passanger station, or not.  

The project includes a data processing pipeline that:  
✔️ Collects data from the APIs.  
✔️ Merges railway and weather data based on location and time.  
✔️ Handles missing data and outliers.  
✔️ Saves the processed data to structured CSV files.

##  Getting Started


**Using `conda` environment** &nbsp; [<img align="center" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/conda-342B029.svg?style={badge_style}&logo=anaconda&logoColor=white" />](https://docs.conda.io/)

```sh
❯ conda venv create -f environment.yml
```

## 🚀 Data Fetcher Flag  
The `DATA_FETCH` flag in `main.py` controls whether the program will **fetch data from the APIs** or **process existing data**.

### 1. **Fetch Data from APIs**  
To fetch data from the Finnish Railway API and FMI API, set the `DATA_FETCH` flag to `True` in `main.py`:

```python
# main.py
DATA_FETCH = True
```

When `DATA_FETCH` is set to `True`, the program will:

✅ Fetch train data within the specified interval and save it to a CSV.  
✅ Fetch weather data from the FMI API within the specified interval and save it to a CSV.  

This mode is used to **download fresh data** from the APIs and **store it locally** for further processing.

### 2. Process Existing Data  
To **process and merge previously fetched data** (without making additional API calls), set the `DATA_FETCH` flag to `False` in `main.py`:

```python
# main.py
DATA_FETCH = False
```

When `DATA_FETCH` is set to `False`, the program will: 

✅ Load data from the locally stored CSV files.  
✅ Match train timetable data with the closest weather station data using the **Haversine distance** calculation.  
✅ Merge the matched data into a structured format for analysis.
